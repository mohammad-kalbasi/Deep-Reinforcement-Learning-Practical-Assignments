# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Practical-Assignments
This repository contains the practical assignments for a Deep Reinforcement Learning course. Throughout these assignments, we implemented various advanced methods, including Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), to solve a range of challenging problems.
